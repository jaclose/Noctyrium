# AXOM Application Checker dataset handoff

The external school scraper must emit one JSON file at:

`web/public/application-schools.json`

The file is a versioned envelope. AXOM accepts schema version `1` for backward
compatibility and upgrades it in memory; new exports should emit version `2`.

```json

  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "sourcePipelineVersion": "scraper-2026-08-10",
  "generatedAt": "2026-08-10T12:00:00Z",

      "missionNotes": "Unknown",
      "verificationStatus": "verified",
      "sources": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.edu/admissions/requirements",
          "title": "Admissions requirements",
          "retrievedAt": "2026-08-10T11:30:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-10T11:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- `id`, `canonicalName`, `verificationStatus`, and `sources` are required.
- `Verified` records must have at least one valid HTTPS/HTTP source and a
  retrieval timestamp.
- Use `Unknown` for missing admissions facts. Do not infer or backfill them.
- `programType` should be `md`, `do`, `md/do`, `residency`, `phd`, `masters`,
  `pa`, `nursing`, or `other`.
- Retrieval timestamps must be ISO date-times and must not be in the future.
- Keep `recordCount` equal to the number of submitted rows.
- A partial run is valid. Rejected rows are reported while valid rows remain
  usable.
- Do not reuse a canonical school under multiple IDs without investigating the
  duplicate-name warning.

Validation and regression procedure:

```bash
cd /Users/jd/Developer/AXOM-accounts-v1/web
npm test -- --run src/lib/applicationSchools.test.ts
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npx playwright test e2e/beta-finishing-surfaces.spec.ts
```

The pure boundary is `parseApplicationSchoolDataset` in
`web/src/lib/applicationSchools.ts`. Incremental scraper output must be merged
with `mergeApplicationSchoolDatasets`; missing incoming fields do not erase
existing fields, and conflicting material values remain visible as field-level
conflicts instead of silently replacing trusted data.
