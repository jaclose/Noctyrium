// ===========================================================================
// Blueprint catalog — the canonical, source-governed content + architecture for
// every exam lane, anchored to the "Blueprint Study God File" and the official
// USMLE / AAMC / NBME / ADA / Acuity outlines. This is a TEMPLATE library; the
// store instantiates per-user InstalledBlueprint containers from these entries.
//
// Authoring rules (from the god file):
//   - Never flatten a lane into lecture "passes". Every node has a real taskType.
//   - Official sources govern; third-party tools are labeled as tools.
//   - For CASPer/DAT, the schema + install architecture is built now and content
//     is scaffolded against the official testing authority (not invented depth).
