// Education tracks. The top-level "what are you studying for" choice, made
// first during onboarding. A track decides three things:
//   1. Structure  — which terms/courses are auto-seeded (Term 1/2 only for SGU).
//   2. Resources  — whether SGU drives show; everyone keeps personal + board drives.
//   3. Lanes      — which ExperienceFocusId options + which blueprint to install.
//
// Every track also carries an explicit *progress model* so "install blueprint"
// is never vague: it states what one pass means and when an item is done, in the
// vocabulary of that program (a prereq course is "passed", a Step domain is
// "mastered", a clinical block is "covered"). This is what makes adding, say, a
// pre-med prerequisite actually mean something instead of "it's a lecture now".
